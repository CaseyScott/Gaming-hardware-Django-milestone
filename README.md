## **Glitch**


## **The Given Brief and Requirements**
Full stack frameworks with Django milestone project.
Glitch is an e-commerce web app for selling high end gaming computer hardware.

Project purpose:
In this project, is a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. It has an authentication mechanism and provide paid access to the site's data and/or other activities based on the dataset, such as the purchase of a product/service.


## **UX**
Glitch is an online high end gaming componet store for purchasing computer parts deicated to PC gaming.
The site is simple to use with Most categories covered. People spending at this level of componentry know exactly the parts they need so it really just comes down to price. Having the best prices avaliable is what will bring customers coming back. There are also 6 pre-built options with the latest hardware at competitive prices.

## **User Stories**
- As a user I want an online gaming store that has the best prices avaliable
- As a user I want to be able to contact the site to request a price comparison or beter.
- As a user spending a lot from overseas stores costs to much with tax and duties, I want a NZ store that can compete with those prices
- As a user I want a simple, easy to use site
- As a user I want to know my credit card and email are safe. 

### Users
- Users of this site can browse all content without registiering but if a user wants to purchase they must be regisitered and signed in to complete this action.

## Existing Features

- Users can regisiter their details and sign in given them the ability to make purchases.
### Home page
- Home page shows categories avaliable in a drop down from the navbar or with carousel images that link to take category.
- Pre-built machines for those that just want to pay and play.
### Departments
- All avaliable components are in departments in their own categories.
### Navigation bar and footer
- Navbar is on every page making it easy for the user to move around the site from category to category, use the search bar or return home at any time.
## Features left to implement
- Categories are hard coded at this stage. This list in real world situation would be a dynamic list so the administrator could change the list and add more categories as the company expands.
- home page to have more information on products instore 
- User feedback about where the completed purchase has been sent to with package tracking.
- return policy for damaged goods.
- User comments on components instore.

- Products ??%

To run testing locally
- pip install coverage
- python manage.py test
- coverage run --source='app name' manage.py test
- coverage html 
htmlcov folder is created where you can run and view the browser version of the report.
   
#### Browser Testing 
All testing on the list of Browers below.

- Opera (no issues found at time of testing)

#### Responsive-Design testing
Responsive testing done on Google DevTools â€“ Device Mode and Browserstack.

## **Deployment**
This project is hosted on Github and a deployed verson hosted on Heroku

## To run this project locally:
- python3 will run the application
- pip will install all requirements
- git version control
For this project I have used VScode for code editor

- Clone or download the zip file from Glitch Repo [here]('https://github.com/CaseyScott/Gaming-hardware-Django-milestone')
- Create a virtual environment
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- Create a file called env.py
- Create a file called .gitignore and add env.py (env.py with contain all environment variables)
- python manage.py runserver   (This will run on http://127.0.0.1:8000) add 127.0.0.1 to allowed hosts in settings.py
- Django will create a new SQlite3 database file called db.sqlite3
- python manage.py makemigrations (will create new migrations based on the changes you have made to the models)
- python manage.py migrate (will apply these migrations)
- python manage.py createsuperuser (will create a super user that has access to the django admin panel)


## Remote deployment:
For this project I have used Heroku platform:
- pip freeze --local > requirements.txt
- Add a Procfile within the project and input 'web: gunicorn django_ms4.wsgi:application'
- Start a new project on [heroku]('heroku.com')
- On heroku dashboard in Resources, go to Add-ons and search for heroku Postpres. This will create a remote database, update the database-url in env.py to use Postgres rather than the local database SQlite3
- In heroku settings go to Config Vars to set up environment variables (SECRET_KEY, EMAIL_ADDRESS, EMAIL_PASSWORD, STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE, STRIPE_SECRET, DATABASE_URL, AWS_SECRET_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)
- Update the settings.py file to connect the remote database using this Python package: dj_database_url
- makemigrations and migrate, create a superuser to the remote database.
- Sign into [Amazon AWS]('https://aws.amazon.com/s3/') to host staticfiles and mediafiles In the S3 bucket. [S3 bucket quickstarts]('https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstarts/latest/s3backup/step-1-create-bucket.html')
- python manage.py collectstatic will push static and media files to the S3 bucket
- Set up [Stripe]('https://stripe.com/') from the Developers section use the STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE, STRIPE_SECRET keys and add them to .env file and heroku Config Vars.
- You can set Automatic deploys from master branch so anything pushes made to github will keep the live version up to date.
