### Automated testing
- I used Travis the continuous integration service [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CaseyScott/Gaming-hardware-Django-milestone.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CaseyScott/Gaming-hardware-Django-milestone)

#### Using Django coverage unit testing
- Accounts 75%
- Cart     56%
- Checkout 79%
- Home     91%
- Products 85%

To run testing locally
- pip install coverage
- python manage.py test
- coverage run --source='app name' manage.py test
- coverage report
- coverage html 
htmlcov folder is created where you can run and view the browser version of the report.
   
#### Stripe payment testing
- Card number - 4242424242424242
- CVC - Any 3 digit number.
- Expiry date - Any date in the future.

#### Validation services
- [HTML Validation]('https://validator.w3.org/')
- [CSS Validation]('https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/')
- [Python Validation]('http://pep8online.com/')
- python flake8 to format systematically

## **Deployment**
This project is hosted on Github and a deployed verson hosted on Heroku

## To run this project locally:
- python3 will run the application
- pip will install all requirements
- git version control
For this project I have used VScode for code editor

- Clone or download the zip file from Glitch Repo [here]('https://github.com/CaseyScott/Gaming-hardware-Django-milestone')
- Create a virtual environment
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- Create a file called env.py
- Create a file called .gitignore and add env.py (env.py with contain all environment variables)
- python manage.py runserver   (This will run on http://127.0.0.1:8000) add 127.0.0.1 to allowed hosts in settings.py
- Django will create a new SQlite3 database file called db.sqlite3
- python manage.py makemigrations (will create new migrations based on the changes you have made to the models)
- python manage.py migrate (will apply these migrations)
- python manage.py createsuperuser (will create a super user that has access to the django admin panel)


## Remote deployment:
For this project I have used Heroku platform:
- pip freeze --local > requirements.txt
- Add a Procfile within the project and input 'web: gunicorn django_ms4.wsgi:application'
- Start a new project on [heroku]('heroku.com')
- On heroku dashboard in Resources, go to Add-ons and search for heroku Postpres. This will create a remote database, update the database-url in env.py to use Postgres rather than the local database SQlite3
- In heroku settings go to Config Vars to set up environment variables (SECRET_KEY, EMAIL_ADDRESS, EMAIL_PASSWORD, STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE, STRIPE_SECRET, DATABASE_URL, AWS_SECRET_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)
- Update the settings.py file to connect the remote database using this Python package: dj_database_url
- makemigrations and migrate, create a superuser to the remote database.
- Sign into [Amazon AWS]('https://aws.amazon.com/s3/') to host staticfiles and mediafiles In the S3 bucket. [S3 bucket quickstarts]('https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstarts/latest/s3backup/step-1-create-bucket.html')
- python manage.py collectstatic will push static and media files to the S3 bucket
- Set up [Stripe]('https://stripe.com/') from the Developers section use the STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE, STRIPE_SECRET keys and add them to .env file and heroku Config Vars.
- You can set Automatic deploys from master branch so anything pushes made to github will keep the live version up to date.

### Content
- The images and product information used on my project was sourced from other online Computer stores and google image search.
